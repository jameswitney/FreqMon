# FreqMon
A very simple shell script that outputs the frequency your CPU cores are running at. I made this simple script after overclocking my CPU, in order to check that p-states were working as I expected them to.

To run the script, download the file 'FreqMon' - this is the executable shell script. Navigate to the directory containing the executable, then run 'sh FreqMon' or simply 'FreqMon'

If you want to run the script from any directory, copy it to a folder in your path.
